				Jen Monroe is an artist, chef, and music curator based in Brooklyn. Her exploratory food project, Bad Taste, was born from a desire to push the boundaries between food and art after years of cooking in restaurants and working in food media. Her work, most notably her series of immersive ten-course monochromatic dinners, has been publicized in The New York Times, Paper, Dazed, and Vogue. Other projects as Bad Taste have included an ongoing series of dinners in response to the honey bee health crisis, a large-scale jello installation at Knockdown Center, a futuristic dinner in response to the effects of climate change, and a series of experimental cotton candy pop-ups.

				You not only create adventurous meals and food art explorations, but you also DJ, you run Listen to This, and you art direct music videos and pop-up installations. I’m wondering if you see a through-line in your work, or even an underlying artistic imperative that propels everything?
				</div>
				<div class="p5" id="p5">
				Ultimately I think the connection is world-building. That for me has always been the imperative for looking at a dinner or a mixtape. There’s always the question, “What is the environment that I want to help somebody step into for an hour, or three hours?” For me it’s a process of approaching food from a visual perspective, as well as a textural perspective. When I plan a menu, it’s usually a texture or a feeling that comes before taste.

					What initially drew you to working with food?
				</div>
				<div class="p7" id="p7">I started learning to cook when I was a sophomore in college, having my own kitchen for the first time and learning to feed myself. </div>
				<div class="sentence1">
					<div class="s1">Having it be meant to be consumed, but still ultimately feeling like you’ve created an art object with your two hands was a really shocking and radical feeling to me.</div>

						From there I went further down the rabbit hole, trying to find a place in the food world. I wrote a food blog, and cooked in restaurants for a little while. I worked in a supper club.it was an incubator job to have while I slowly figured out how to get this food project off the ground. In 2014 my sister and I started hosting monochromatic dinner parties in our apartment. I had some cooking background up to that point but I knew that I didn’t want to be a chef in any kind of conventional sense.
					</div>
					<div class="p9 light" id="p9">
						So that dinner series was the first?
					</div>
					<div class="p10" id="p10">
						Yes, but they weren’t public-facing. They were for six people in our apartment for fun, very half-baked. That was the first thing I had done in years that scratched the itch.
					</div>
					<div class="p11 light" id="p11">
						It’s fundamental to the human experience. And it’s got such a high utility function. Can you talk a little bit about how you see food both inside and outside of “art?” Or if you find yourself having to navigate that boundary much?
					</div>
					<div class="p12" id="p12">
						I think any chef who tries to tell you, “My relationship with food is only beautiful and poetic and lofty,” is either lying or a gajillionaire and being waited on hand and foot. Especially as one who works with food in my livelihood, it is physical labor. It is often backbreaking, finger-bleeding, exhausted, underslept, over-caffeinated, haven’t-had-a-vegetable-in-a-couple-days kind of labor. And that’s just real. That’s part of the hustle.<br>
						<br>
						But on the flip side of that is exactly what you said, that food is an essential resource and it’s one that I happen to have really privileged access to. It effectively feels like standing on top of a pedestal and saying,<br>
						<br>
						“Ha ha ha, I have access to so much that I can afford to turn these bananas into a Christmas tree full of banana dolphins.” <br>
						<br>
						It’s deeply privileged, and it’s something that I’ve run into over and over again.<br>
						<br>
						Ultimately where I keep landing is that all chefs are artists, and while I always want to be mindful of food access and respect and waste. How can we continue to invent pleasure for ourselves in a world of scarcity, and what can envisioning that future do to change our current relationship to food, or to the world?<br>

						Food is an interesting canvas for creative work, because it’s so essential.

							Within the past year you shifted to being fully freelance. Can you talk about how that transition has been? How do you create boundaries between work and life? What do you struggle with the most?
						</div>
						<div class="p14" id="p14">
							The hardest part is time management. I work really well under a tight deadline, and I have a hard time sitting down and being diligent. Having clean work/life hygiene is hard but also important. Especially when you’re a freelancer who’s “doing what you love,” those things start to get murky quickly. Know when to turn it off. Routine is also really important to have good infrastructure about going to bed at a decent hour, and waking up at a decent hour.
						</div>
						<div class="p15 light" id="p15">
							Do you have any freelance hacks?
						</div>
						<div class="p16" id="p16">
							I don’t know if this is a great hack, but I have a dog, and he forces me to go for a walk first thing in the morning. And that, especially recently, has turned into a really beloved ritual.
						</div>
						<div class="p17 light" id="p17">
							Dog hack.
						</div>
						<div class="p18" id="p18">
							Dog hack! <br>
							<br>
							Wake up, take the dog out, get a tiny cup of bad bodega coffee, which is my joy in the morning. That’s been a beautiful way to start the day. Then I can come home and feel like my brain is awake, and I can sit down and jump in.
						</div>
						<div class="p19" id="p19">
							Also, reward systems. Right now it’s orange season, so I have some really tasty oranges that I have been periodically rewarding myself with. But treats can take many forms. They can be playing a game, or having a reading break, or a favorite snack, or playing with your dog. That stuff all helps.

						<div class="circle7">
							<div class="s3">
								Don’t be afraid of a steep learning curve, because they’re easily the most rewarding ones.

						<div class="p20 light" id="p20">
							Can we talk a little bit about how you define success, or understand it? What does success mean to you? Or what would you like it to mean to you?
						</div>
						<div class="p21" id="p21">
							It’s funny because a lot of the things that have happened to me more recently are things that I was so desperate for five years ago and used to think.
						</div>
						<div class="p22" id="p22">
							I would like success to feel like you have given rise to a useful conversation. And I guess that’s a broad desire for a reason. It could mean a lot of different things. But I think the reason people have children is because they want to be remembered after they die. And I guess in my mind, success is maybe a little bit less narcissistic than that, but I would like to have contributed in a productive way to a narrative that will continue after I’m dead. I don’t know if one can ever really know if that’s the case. But one can hope. <br>
							<br>
							I think you can know that your ideas, your creative output has an effect. You’ll never be able to trace it in a finite way, because it’ll keep moving and changing—that’s the way ideas work. But I like that as being the definition of success, just contributing something to the ether. Something positive.<br>
							<br>
							It’s the butterfly effect. You never know what’s going to land where and who your work is going to end up in front of and what it’s going to make them feel, what it’s going to make them do.
						</div>
						<div class="p23 light" id="p23">
							I don’t know if this is an answerable question, I just wrote it because it felt good to me. But when do you feel the most free?
						</div>
						<div class="p24" id="p24">
							That’s a great question. I said this to my boyfriend a while back: I realized that the moments when I am several days deep into a crazy food project and I’ve been doing back-to-back 16 hour prep days, I’m underslept, over-caffeinated, and I haven’t thought about whether I look particularly cute in a while, I’m wearing functional clothes and I feel like my body is just a tool, I’m a machine that’s working effectively, those are the moments when I feel the most free. When I can be just a brain and just a body. And I realized that a big part of what feels so good about that is that it’s the only time in my life when I’m not thinking about what I look like. It feels amazing.
